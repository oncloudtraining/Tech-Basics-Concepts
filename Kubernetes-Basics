#Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a flexible and scalable architecture that allows you to run, manage, and monitor containers in a clustered environment.

Advantages of using Kubernetes?

#Scalability: Kubernetes allows you to easily scale your application up or down based on demand.
#High_availability: Kubernetes provides a highly available environment for your applications.
#Flexibility: Kubernetes supports multiple container runtimes and can run on a variety of infrastructures.
#Resource_optimization: Kubernetes ensures that resources are used efficiently and optimally.
#Self_healing: Kubernetes can detect and automatically recover from failures in your applications.

#Pod in Kubernetes?
A pod is the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes. It is a logical host for one or more containers and represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster.

#Deployment in Kubernetes?
A deployment in Kubernetes is a resource object that manages the deployment of a containerized application. It provides declarative updates for pods and replica sets.

#Service in Kubernetes?
A service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name for pods, and allows them to be accessed by other pods or external services.

#Namespace in Kubernetes?
A namespace in Kubernetes is a way to partition a single cluster into multiple virtual clusters. It provides a way to organize and isolate resources within a cluster.

#Config_map in Kubernetes?
A config map in Kubernetes is a key-value store that can be used to store configuration data that is consumed by applications running in a cluster.

#Secret in Kubernetes?
A secret in Kubernetes is a way to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates. Secrets are stored securely within a cluster and can be accessed by pods and containers.

#Node in Kubernetes?
A node in Kubernetes is a physical or virtual machine that is part of a cluster. It runs the Kubernetes runtime environment and is responsible for running pods.

#Container in Kubernetes?
A container in Kubernetes is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained runtime environment that includes everything needed to run an application, including code, dependencies, and libraries. Containers are deployed and managed by Kubernetes.
